# CS2s 

This guide is for the 3Dconnexion SpaceMouseÂ® to control the camera in Cities: Skylines 2 (Windows only)
I'm assuming you are using the standard key mappings for controlling the camera.

I've also assigned the left [Space] and right [ESC] buttons to but I'm sure there's something better you can figure out to do with them.

Use the "Import/Export settings" function, which can be found in the software after a click on "More >". If you are editing the changes directly in the XML in the Cfg folder, no restart of the game or the 3Dconnexion software is required to apply the settings, as the software watches for file modifications and automatically applies them after you save the file.
The file location will be in %AppData%\Roaming\3Dconnexion\3DxWare\Cfg\Cities2-KMJ.xml

If you would like to edit the Cities2-KMJ.xml use a editor like Notepad++. The keyboard codes here: http://www.freebsddiary.org/APC/usb_hid_usages.php
